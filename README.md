quantadistribution
==================

Quick and hacky model of the distribution of energy in atoms, using the model that all atoms have the same ammount of quantised energy to begin with, and this is randomly passed to another atom, with one exchange per iteration for many iterations.
The resultant distribution of frequencies is then drawn as a bar chart to the console.
